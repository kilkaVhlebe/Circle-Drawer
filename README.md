## Project Description
This is a mini-project that uses the `robotjs` library to draw a circle on your computer screen.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need Node.js. You can install it by following the instructions on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

After installing Node.js, you can install `robotjs` using npm (Node Package Manager), which comes bundled with Node.js. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
npm install robotjs
```

## Usage
To use this project, copy the code from the `index.js` file (or whatever you name it) and run it using Node.js:

```bash
node src/index.js
```
(if you in main project directory)

## How It Works
The project uses the `robotjs` library to control the mouse. It calculates the coordinates of points along a circle with a given radius and then moves the mouse cursor along these points, creating a visualization of a circle.
